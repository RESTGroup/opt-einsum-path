# opt-einsum-path for Rust

This crate performs **path optimization of tensor contraction** (not performing the actual tensor contraction).

This is a re-implementation (with minor modifications) to [opt_einsum](https://github.com/dgasmith/opt_einsum).

**Currently it has not reached v0.1**. It is planned to be deployed to crates.io in near future.

This is originally developed for developing rust tensor toolkit [RSTSR](https://github.com/RESTGroup/rstsr) and electronic structure toolkit [REST](https://gitee.com/RESTGroup/REST). It is not a formal project related to [opt_einsum](https://github.com/dgasmith/opt_einsum).

This crate contains code assisted by AI (deepseek).
